This project is a simple multithreaded web server coded in Rust ðŸ¦€.
The purpose is to code in Rust and learn about:

- TCP and HTTP protocols
- Listening TCP connections on a socket
- Parsing HTTP requests
- Creating HTTP response
- Creating a thread pool

This project is part of the Rust learning journey from the book _The rust programming language_
and it is my first Rust project.
